This is a very simple tool. You can use it to send some http
request. I'm a newbie on http field. Thanks to Thomas and Yifan, for
helping me figure out HTTP stuff and write this program.

shawn@bt:/arsenal-4-sec-testing/http$ ./http_request.py www.heise.de 80 "OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.heise.de\r\nAccept: *\r\n\r\n"
send:
OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1
Host: www.heise.de
Accept: *


Response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
