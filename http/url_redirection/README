What makes motivation ticks?

One friend asked me once, what are these attacker will do if they
already wired in some networking gateway device? This program is
trying to answer his/her question at some aspect. Here's my
assumptions:

1, A networking gateway device was running with GNU/Linux.
=> So, we can use netfilter features

2, We've already hacked( hack is a postive/divine word) into this
device.

3, Attacker want to redirect some url to a phishing site.

I tried to write a netfilter-based url redirection stuff. I spent 2
days to write the POC code. It still didn't work yet. It might has
some checksum issue there. It'd be ok. I will levea the issue to the
future when I have enough knowledge about TCP/IP network. It'd be
welcomed to those who are willing to improve this unfinished artifact.
