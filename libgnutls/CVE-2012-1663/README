CVE-2013-1663 is a possible remote DOS attack issue. I'm not sure how
to make it that happend. Because the server side example code won't be
the trigger to do the double free manipulations. I need more time to
dig deeper on it. I just made these examples run today:

shawn@sl13:~/gnutls_compile_uses/CVE-2012-1663$ ./ex-serv-x509 
processing server set to null?
Server ready. Listening to port '5556'.

shawn@sl13:~/gnutls_compile_uses/CVE-2012-1663$ ./attack.sh

Another terminal: killall client
