What is BT5-firewall?

It's a bunch of iptables polices which copy from SuSEfirewall.

Motivations?

BackTrack is a great GNU/Linux distro for pentesting. How can a
pentesting distro doesn't have any networking filters? It will be
ironic story if a pentester being cracked by some script kids-_-

How to use?

├── disable_firewall
├── enable_firewall
├── README
└── susefirewall.log /* You need to modify the network interfaces for ur own */

It's pretty easy to use it on your own GNU/Linux. Make sure your
GNU/Linux already has netfilter/iptables. Then "enable_firewall" and
"disable_firewall" will be your friendly arsenal.
